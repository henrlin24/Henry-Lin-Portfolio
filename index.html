                                    Gacha Slimes is a 2D platformer, and is the second project I made for EECS 494. The game was created individually by me, but does make use of free visual and audio assets.
                                    The core idea behind the game behind the game is to create a platformer that has a core "gacha" mechanic that would change the way that players progress through the levels.

                                <p>
                                    The game was developed using the Unity Engine. Specific contributions from me include creating movement and attack scripts, prefabs for the slime enemies and interactable objects in the levels, as well as scene management scripts.
                                    The UI was also a major part of development, where I implemented UI elements linked to the game objects by making use of an Eventbus scheme.
                                    The "gacha" sequence involved making use of coroutines to play out the "animations" and pausing the game in the background when the gacha interface was active.
                                    Core mechanics and game level design, as well as the corresponding playtest and feedback, were also major parts of my development process.
