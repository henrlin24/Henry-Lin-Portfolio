                                    Gacha Slimes is a 2D platformer, and is the second project I made for EECS 494. The game was created individually, but does make use of free visual and audio assets.
                                    The core idea behind the game behind the game is to create a platformer that has a core "gacha" mechanic that would change the way that players progress through the levels.
