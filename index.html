                                        Cavelit is a 2D platformer game, developed by a 5 person team for EECS 494. It also includes freelance contributions for music, SFX, and voicing.
                                        You play as Bob, a miner who has be caught in a cave-in, and need to find a way out of the depths.

                                        The game was developed using the Unity Engine. Additional details are to be included here, likely in the form of links or direct references to our dev blogs.

                                        Gacha Slimes is a 2D platformer, and is the second project I made for EECS 494. The game was created individually by me, but does make use of free visual and audio assets.
                                        The core idea behind the game behind the game is to create a platformer that has a core "gacha" mechanic that would change the way that players progress through the levels.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The game was developed using the Unity Engine. Specific contributions from me include creating movement and attack scripts, prefabs for the slime enemies and interactable objects in the levels, as well as scene management scripts.
                                        The UI was also a major part of development, where I implemented UI elements linked to the game objects by making use of an Eventbus scheme.
                                        The "gacha" sequence involved making use of coroutines to play out the "animations" and pausing the game in the background when the gacha interface was active.
                                        Core mechanics and game level design, as well as the corresponding playtest and feedback, were also major parts of my development process.
                                        Changes were kept track of using a Github repository, as well as Jira to keep track of tasks.

                                        This is a Legend of Zelda clone, created with a partner as the first project in EECS 494.
                                        This involved remaking the first dungeon of the original NES game, including the enemies, traps, and weapons availiable at that point in the game.
                                        Additionally, we also implemented our own custom mechanic and level â€” a moving laser obstacle that only damages the player when they are moving, inspired by a similar mechanic featured in Undertale.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My specific contributions to this project include the implementation of the Keese (the bat enemies), which involved a randomized non-grid based movement different from the other enemies, as well as Aquamentus (the boss) and the Wallmaster enemies (the hands that grab the player, sending them to the beginning of the dungeon).
                                        I implemented many of the environmental aspects of the game. Water tiles, pushable blocks, locked doors & keys, pickups, and room transition sequences are among this list.
                                        Other core gameplay elements I worked include player health and UI, the implementation of god mode (cheat mode, allows for easier time testing), as well as contributing towards the custom mechanic and level design.
                                        I notably implemented the starting tutorial sequence of the custom level.

                                        A simple Roll-a-Ball game created as part of setup for EECS 494.
                                        This included implementing a simple movement script, a jump mechanic that made use of raycasts to determine if the player was on ground (and hence could jump), as well as an updating UI score counter.
                                        The 3D models used in the game were from the Unity Asset Store as free assets.
