                                Setup included getting SourceTree set up and running as my Git client, as well as getting my Jira/Confluence/BitBucket account.
                                As part of the programming team onboarding, we were to also implement either a console command or achievement.
                                I implemented a console command to obtain the contents of the player inventory, and successfully created my first pull request for the project.

                                    For the second week, I started working on the main HUD, specifically on health bar modifications and a few general UI scripts.
                                    There was a bit of initial time spent on looking through the UI design documentation, as well as looking through the existing codebase to see what I was working off of.
                                    A placeholder health bar display object was already in place, to which I added threshold and corresponding color parameters to better indicate low player health.
                                    I then created a general UI fade, lerp, and shake scripts. The lerp and shake scripts notably came about from testing different methods to produce the health shake effect desired by the design team.
                                    I would also try to test out Mathf.PingPong(), but that turned out to not work as well as the Lerp implementation.
                                    The final "shake" script utilzed Hooke's Law, the application of which I learned from EECS 494. For the shake script, I also created the corresponding Unity event and listener.

                                    For the third week, I updated and made additions to main HUD features from week 2, created a basic title scene, as well as implemented an initial weapon ui display.
                                    To start, I updated a the lerp and fade scripts from week 2 to work as callback functions for future events.
                                    I then updated the health bar display to work with the new shield system, as well create a shield ui display.
                                    The shield ui display also included creating a Unity event and listener to update shield ui when it regenerates or decreases.
                                    I then went about to creating a stamina bar, which was an UI element that was to be attached to the player object, and thus relative to the player's position on the screen.
                                    This was done by making a UI canvas that was a child to the player object. 
                                    I then worked on the title scene, of which most of the time was spent relearning how buttons and onclick functionality worked in Unity.
                                    A main menu and placeholders for submenus (e.g. settings and credits) was created for this initial title screen.
                                    Finally, I created the weapon ui display, which would turn out to be two sibling displays for melee and ranged weapons respectively.
                                    Of note, my branch encountered a few issues during the weapon ui development, and led to me having to reset my scene a couple of times.
                                    Much of my time was spent just redoing my work, as well as readjusting elements after merging in the master build to my branch for the final pull request.
