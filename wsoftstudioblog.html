                                Setup included getting SourceTree set up and running as my Git client, as well as getting my Jira/Confluence/BitBucket account.
                                As part of the programming team onboarding, we were to also implement either a console command or achievement.
                                I implemented a console command to obtain the contents of the player inventory, and successfully created my first pull request for the project.

                                    For the second week, I started working on the main HUD, specifically on health bar modifications and a few general UI scripts.
                                    I spent an hour or so looking through the UI design documentation, as well as looking through the existing codebase to see what I was working off of.
                                    A placeholder health bar display object was already in place, to which I added threshold and corresponding color parameters to better indicate low player health in another hour.
                                    <br>
                                    I then created a general UI fade, lerp, and shake scripts.
                                    Testing out different methods to create a shaking healthbar on hit would overall be a needless timesink in hindsight, as I spent around 3-4 hours testing out different methods.
                                    The lerp and shake scripts were the end results of testing different methods to produce the health shake effect.
                                    I would also try to test out Mathf.PingPong(), but that turned out to not work as well as the Lerp and shake implementation.
                                    The final "shake" script utilzed Hooke's Law, the application of which I learned from EECS 494. For the shake script, I also created the corresponding Unity event and listener.
                                    <br>
                                    The UI fade ended up taking about an hour, and an overall much better utilization of time.

                                    For the third week, I updated and made additions to main HUD features from week 2, created a basic title scene, as well as implemented an initial weapon UI display.
                                    To start, I updated a the lerp and fade scripts from week 2 to work as callback functions for future events, taking about 30 minutes including consulting my programming lead.
                                    <br>
                                    I then updated the health bar display to work with the new shield system, as well create a shield UI display.
                                    The shield UI display also included creating a Unity event and listener to update shield UI when it regenerates or decreases.
                                    I then went about to creating a stamina bar, which was an UI element that was to be attached to the player object, and thus relative to the player's position on the screen.
                                    This was done by making a UI canvas that was a child to the player object.
                                    The shields and stamina would take about an hour each, for two hours total between the two.
                                    <br>
                                    I then worked on the title scene, of which most of the two hours developing was spent relearning how buttons and onclick functionality worked in Unity.
                                    A main menu and placeholders for submenus (e.g. settings and credits) was created for this initial title screen.
                                    <br>
                                    Finally, I created the weapon UI display, which would turn out to be two sibling displays for melee and ranged weapons respectively.
                                    About 1.5 hours was spent looking into the design specifications and looking into how the weapon UI looked in Hyper Light Drift.
                                    I then spent about 1.5 hours creating the initial melee weapon UI.
                                    Another 1.5 hours was spent on refining some issues, such as display layer priority, as well as implementing a corresponding ranged weapon UI.
                                    My build notably did encounter a few issues during the weapon UI development, and led to me having to reset my progress a few times.
                                    The player would not be able to move during playtesting, and would not load in a default weapon to test the weapon UI with.
                                    After consulting my programming lead and creating a new branch, I managed to get the weapon UI working again but it stil ate up aobut 2 hours here.
                                    I then spent about 30 minutes readjusting the UI after merging in from the master to minimize bugs when merging, and made my final feature pull request for the sprint.
